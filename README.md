# WIP Title Vermine Game

Currently a personal project I am working on with a close friend. Attempting to apply what I've learned about good OOP and creating code systems to create readable and efficient code for a menu heavy gaming experience.

The game is planned to feature large amounts of dialogue, a catalogue of characters, text and cutscene animations, inventory systems, dynamic multiroom environments, and immersive story-delivering design.

Technically, I am designing this to be as easily interchangeable as possible from a development point of view. The program should be able to read in text files and display them dynamically through animation and sound to convey the game's story,
without necessitating changes to the code for every file added. 

To achieve this I have created data objects that can be managed within the editor where entries can be Created, Read, Updated, or Deleted using the UI provided by Unity for:
 - Text formatting
 - Sound effects
 - Animation effects
 - Character portraits and names
 - [TBC]

I have also added easy ways to add dynamic slideshow-style cutscenes through the editor, and a system that will load and format text files into the game to be interpreted by a text formatter.
